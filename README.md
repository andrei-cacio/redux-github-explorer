# Redux Github explorer
*this project was made for learning purposes only*

### Motivation
Whenever I started a new project I always repeated the same steps over and over.
So I decided to put together a quick project starter for rapid bootstraping.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Open in your favourite browser (Chrome) this url: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Open the folder in your favourite text editor/IDE.

Happy coding :coffee:!

## NPM scripts

`npm start` - opens a dev server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

`npm t` - runs the test suite

`npm run cover` - prints the test coverage output table

`npm run build` - builds the project

`npm run build:prod` - builds the project for production

`npm run lint` - lints the source code
